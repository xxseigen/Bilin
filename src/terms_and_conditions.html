                                <li>Licensed food establishments are encouraged to donate surplus foods. Because licensed food establishments have commercial-grade equipment, these may safely include foods that have gone through typical multiple food preparation steps and are handled with the same consideration for safety as the food sold to customers.</li>
                                <li>Perishable goods past the original manufacturer's “sell by” (or “best if used by”) date are suitable for donation, but not foods past a “use by” (or “consume before”) date. Other items not suitable for donation include foods that have been temperature abused; foods that have been served to a customer's table; spoiled foods; foods exposed to potential contamination by severe package damage; and sharply dented or rusty cans.</li>
                                <li>Food processors are encouraged to donate foods that may not meet their specifications for reasons that do not affect food safety, such as package printing errors. Each food package may lack the complete labeling required for commercial distribution, as long as the charitable distributing organization is given enough information to mark each container with the common name of the food. At least one accurate, complete label must be provided with each master carton.</li>
                            </ul>
                        <h5><li style="font-weight: bold;">Liability for Damages from Donated Food</li></h5>
                            <p>In accordance with Republic Act No. 9803 Section 5, “a person, whether natural or juridical, shall not be subject to civil or criminal liability arising from the nature, age, packaging, or condition of apparently wholesome food that a person donates in good faith for charitable purposes. This shall not apply, however, to an injury or death of an ultimate beneficiary of the donated food that results from an act or omission of a person constituting gross negligence or intentional misconduct.” Also, we do not assume and shall not have any liability or responsibility should this incident occur.</p>
                        <h5><li style="font-weight: bold;">Warranty Disclaimer</li></h5>
                            <p>Donor hereby expressly disclaims all warranties, written or oral, statutory, express or implied, including any warranty of wholesomeness, merchantability, condition, quality, fitness for use, or suitability of the Goods in any respect whatsoever, including any warranty regarding the absence of any defects therein, whether latent or patent; it being understood and agreed that the Goods are being donated in their current condition. </p>
                            <p>In connection with the Donor's donation of the Goods, Hiraya and the Donor shall in no event be liable for any claim whatsoever by or through Recipient, or any third party, for any issue or problem with the Goods, whether such claim is based in any form of warranty, contract, tort (including negligence), strict liability or otherwise and whether for direct, incidental, consequential, exemplary or other damages, except to the extent that any such liability cannot be released or waived under applicable Federal, state or local law. Donor neither assumes nor authorize any person to assume on their behalf any liability in connection with the use or reuse of the Goods.</p>
